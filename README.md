# MKTO-PD Sync App

[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hjonin/mkto-pd-sync-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hjonin/mkto-pd-sync-app)

MKTO-PD Sync App is a Flask application running on a Google App Engine that synchronizes data between marketing software Marketo and CRM Pipedrive.


## Features

The application handles user requests **asynchronously** using **task (push) queues**.

### Marketo module

Simple Python client for the Marketo REST API.

#### Features

**Lead**, **opportunities**, **roles** and **companies** are **classes** that can be instantiated given a Marketo **client** instance.

All **fields** are **loaded** and available for **reading** and a defined **subset** for each entity is available for **updating**.

An entity also has an "**id field**" that will be used to match an existing entity.

An **existing** entity can be **loaded** given an identifier to the constructor and an eventual id field to look for different from its actual one
which can be any exiting field for leads but should be a "**searchable field**" for opportunities, roles and companies.

An entity can be **saved**: it is then **created** or **updated** depending on if it matches an existing one.

An entity can be **deleted**.

#### Usage

```python
import sync.marketo as marketo

mkto = marketo.MarketoClient(IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, API_ENDPOINT)

# Get a lead by id
lead = marketo.Lead(mkto, "12345")

# Get a lead by email
lead = marketo.Lead(mkto, "lead@mail.com", "email")

# Update lead data
lead.firstName = "New Name"
lead.save()

# Delete lead
lead.delete()
```

### Pipedrive module

Simple Python client for the Pipedrive REST API.

#### Features

**People**, **organizations**, **deals** and **activities** are classes that can be instantiated given a Pipedrive **client** instance.

All **fields** are **loaded** and available for reading and updating.

An **existing** entity can be **loaded** given an **identifier** or a **name** if the "id field" parameter is given as "name". A lead can also be loaded given a **custom filter** a the "id field". Currently supported filters are "email domain" and "marketo id".

**Custom fields** can be read using the snake case display name rather than their hash key.

Some entities are **related** to other and can be loaded as well if so.

An entity can be **saved**: it is then **created** or **updated** depending on if it matches an existing one.

For related entities, only the association can be updated (**no cascade update**).

An entity can be **deleted**.

#### Usage

```python
import sync.pipedrive as pipedrive

pd = pipedrive.PipedriveClient(PD_API_TOKEN)

# Get a person by id
person = pipedrive.Person(pd, "12345")

# Get an organization by name
organization = pipedrive.Organization(pd, "MyCompany", "name")

# Get a person custom field with its nicer name
person.lead_score  # or getattr(person, {HASH KEY})

# Get a person related organization
organization = person.organization

# Update person data
person.name = "New Name"
person.save()

# Delete person
person.delete()
```

### API reference

All requests to the API must be made over SSL (https not http) and validated against the `prod` key (see configuration).

#### List of endpoints

- **POST**: `/marketo/lead/<int:lead_id>`: to send lead data from Marketo to Pipedrive

Actually synchronizes data if and only if it is new or it has changed.

- **POST**: `/pipedrive/person/<int:person_id>` (or `/pipedrive/person` for Pipedrive notification usage): to send person data from Pipedrive to Marketo

Actually synchronizes data if and only if it is new or it has changed.

- **POST**: `/pipedrive/organization/<int:organization_id>` (or `/pipedrive/organization` for Pipedrive notification usage): to send organization data from Pipedrive to Marketo

Actually synchronizes data if and only if it is new or it has changed.

- **POST**: `/pipedrive/deal/<int:deal_id>` (or `/pipedrive/deal` for Pipedrive notification usage): to send deal data from Pipedrive to Marketo

Actually synchronizes data if and only if it is new or it has changed.

- **POST**: `/marketo/lead/<int:lead_pipedrive_id>/delete`: to delete a person in Pipedrive (using lead pipedrive id)

- **POST**: `/pipedrive/person/<int:pipedrive_marketo_id>/delete` (or `/pipedrive/person/delete` for Pipedrive notification usage): to delete a lead in Marketo (using person marketo id)

- **POST**: `/marketo/lead/<int:lead_id>/activity` : to send an activity to Pipedrive from Marketo lead data. It allows a parameter `type` which if set to `email_sent` send activities to Pipedrive from the latest Emails sent the same day in Marketo.

- **POST**: `/pipedrive/organization/<int:organization_id>/compute` (or `/pipedrive/organization/compute` for Pipedrive notification usage): to compute organization data in Pipedrive

- **POST**: `/pipedrive/deal/notify` (for Pipedrive notification usage only): to notify about a deal (status change and note added) in Slack

### Mapping

A mapping file describes how Marketo and Pipedrive entity fields should be matched.

#### Structure
```
MAPPING_NAME = {
    to_field_key_1: {
        "fields": [from_field_key_1, [from_field_key_2...]],
        ["mode": "join"/"choose",]
        ["pre_adapter": function,]
        ["post_adapter": function]
    },
    to_field_key_2: {
        "transformer": function
    }
}
```

## Development

### Requirements

- Install and initialize the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/).
- Create a Google Cloud Platform Console project.
- Install [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-javascript-and-web-developers/neonr) and import the project.
- Create a a [path variable](http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fcpathvars.htm) `HOME` that targets the folder where you extracted the SDK (see [also](docs/assets/path_variable.png)).

### Installation

Assuming you already have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) installed:
- Install the required packages into a `lib/` folder:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt -t lib/
```

### Configuration

* Create an `instance` folder in the root folder of the project.
* Copy the `config.py.sample` file to this folder (remove the `.sample` extension) and set:
  * `IDENTITY_ENDPOINT`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `API_ENDPOINT` from your Marketo credentials,
  * `PD_API_TOKEN` from your Pipedrive API token,
  * `FLASK_AUTHORIZED_KEYS` with any keys (one for unit testing and the other for production).
  * `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` and `DATADOG_API_KEY`

`DEBUG` and `TESTING` are logging control variables.

### Running

```
dev_appserver.py -A sync-app app.yaml worker.yaml  # Start the local development server
```

### Testing

Marketo and Pipedrive clients are tested in the `tests` module but should not be continuously run as they actually call Marketo and Pipedrive APIs. 

The application is also tested in this module where calls to the APIs have been mocked (see files in the `resources` folder under `tests`).

Launch the test:

```
export GOOGLE_APP_ENGINE={PATH_TO_YOUR_GOOGLE_SDK}/platform/google_appengine
python -m tests.test_sync
```

To run the test in Eclipse, you must change the `Working directory` to `Default` (see [this screenshot](docs/assets/run_config1.png)) and set an environment variable for `GOOGLE_APP_ENGINE` pointing to the directory where you extracted the SDK (see [this other screenshot](docs/assets/run_config2.png)) in your configuration.

To run a single unit test in Eclipse you can use the keybinding **CTRL + F9** while the file open.

## Deployment

You can [upload](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadinganapp) the application running the following command from within the root directory of the project (don't forget the `config.py` file):
```
gcloud app deploy app.yaml worker.yaml queue.yaml [--project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]]
```
or
```
gcloud config set project marketo-1041
gcloud components update
gcloud app deploy app.yaml worker.yaml queue.yaml
```

Otherwise, this project is continuously delivered (tested and deployed) with Travis and triggered by a push to the master branch of this repository
